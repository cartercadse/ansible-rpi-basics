# Control a PWM Fan on a Raspberry Pi

Tested on Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4B but should work on other versions as well. 

# Installation

* Connect PWM capable Fan to GND, 5V and GPIO 12 (Pin 32)
* Copy or link RPiFanControl.service to /etc/systemd/system/RPiFanControl.service
  * `sudo ln -s $PWD/RPiFanControl.service /etc/systemd/system/RPiFanControl.service`
* Copy or link RPiFanControl.py to /usr/local/bin/RPiFanControl.py
  * `sudo ln -s $PWD/RPiFanControl.py /usr/local/bin/RPiFanControl.py` 
* Install python requirements
  * Run `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Enable system service
  * Run `sudo systemctl enable RPiFanControl`
* Add `dtoverlay=pwm-2chan,pin=12,func=4,pin2=13,func2=4` to /boot/config.txt and 
* **Reboot your Pi**

# Usage

Once the script is running it will control the connected fan according to the settings.  
See comments in RPiFanControl.py for details. 

It will by default also update two files with the current values on each change:
* `/run/RPiFanControl/temperature` contains the current CPU temperature in Â°C as a float
* `/run/RPiFanControl/dutycycle` contains the current PWM duty cycle in % as an integer
